## Context
Building a modern CRM restaurant reservation system from scratch with the following constraints and requirements:
- Must run locally during development
- Target deployment on EasyPanel (user's server)
- Need to support Spanish language for UI
- Must handle timezone-specific operations (Europe/Madrid)
- Should be scalable for multiple restaurants in the future
- Mobile-responsive design required

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Clean, maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns
  - Modern development experience with hot reload and fast builds
  - Comprehensive testing strategy from day one
  - Security-first approach with proper authentication
  - Performance optimized for mobile and desktop
  - Easy deployment and monitoring
- Non-Goals:
  - Multi-tenancy in initial version (single restaurant focus)
  - Real-time websockets (can be added later)
  - Advanced analytics beyond basic metrics
  - Third-party integrations (email, SMS, payments) in V1

## Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Rationale**: Provides SSR/SSG capabilities, excellent developer experience, built-in optimizations, and TypeScript for type safety
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Vite + React: Faster build but less integrated solution
  - Remix: Good but smaller ecosystem
  - Plain CRA: Too basic for our needs

### Backend Architecture
- **Decision**: Next.js API routes with Prisma ORM
- **Rationale**: Monolithic approach is simpler for single restaurant, Prisma provides type-safe database access, API routes are built-in
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Express + separate frontend: More complex deployment
  - tRPC: Type-safe but adds learning curve
  - NestJS: Overkill for current scope

### Database Choice
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Rationale**: Robust, reliable, good for complex queries, Prisma provides excellent DX
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - MongoDB: Less structured, not ideal for restaurant data
  - MySQL: Good but PostgreSQL has more features
  - SQLite: Not suitable for production

### Styling Approach
- **Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Rationale**: Rapid development, consistent design, small bundle size, highly customizable
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - CSS Modules: More verbose
  - Styled Components: Runtime overhead
  - Material-UI: Less flexible for custom design

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Stateless, works well with Next.js, secure, standard approach
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Session-based: More complex with API routes
  - NextAuth.js: Overkill for current needs
  - Third-party auth: Adds dependency and cost

### Deployment Strategy
- **Decision**: Docker containers with EasyPanel orchestration
- **Rationale**: Consistent environments, easy scaling, user already has EasyPanel
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Vercel: Expensive for custom server needs
  - AWS: Too complex for current scope
  - Traditional VPS: Manual deployment overhead

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Database schema changes requiring migrations
  - **Mitigation**: Use Prisma migrations, version control schema changes
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, caching, and query optimization
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in authentication
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries, regular security audits

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Scope creep leading to delayed launch
  - **Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition, phased rollout
- **Risk**: User adoption challenges
  - **Mitigation**: Intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation

### Trade-offs
- **Monolithic vs Microservices**: Chose monolithic for simplicity, can split later if needed
- **Real-time vs Polling**: Chose polling for simplicity, can add WebSocket later
- **Custom CSS vs UI Library**: Chose custom CSS for unique design, more development time

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Set up project structure and basic tooling
2. Implement database schema and migrations
3. Create basic authentication system
4. Build core UI components

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
1. Implement reservation management
2. Build table management system
3. Create dashboard and analytics
4. Add restaurant settings

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Weeks 5-6)
1. Comprehensive testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Security hardening
4. Documentation

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 7)
1. Docker configuration
2. EasyPanel setup
3. Production testing
4. Data migration (if needed)

### Rollback Strategy
- Database backups before each migration
- Git tags for each deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Open Questions
- Should we implement a notification system in V1 or defer to V2?
- What level of analytics is needed for initial launch?
- Should we support multiple languages from the start or add later?
- What's the strategy for handling timezone differences in multi-location scenarios?
- Should we implement a mobile app or focus on responsive web?

## Performance Considerations
- Database indexing strategy for reservation queries
- Caching frequently accessed data (restaurant settings, table layouts)
- Image optimization for restaurant photos
- API response compression
- Lazy loading for large data sets

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma
- XSS protection in React
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure password hashing
- JWT token security
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## Monitoring Strategy
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
- Database performance metrics
- User activity analytics
- System health checks
- Log aggregation and analysis
